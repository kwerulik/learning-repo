# learning-repo

This repository contains coding exercises and small projects I've completed while learning different programming languages and technologies.

It includes work from:
- 📚 **Online courses** (`javascript/course/`, `html/course`)
- 🎓 **University classes** (`javascript/Uni/`, `basics-csharp-python/`,  `react/`, `basics-csharp-python`...)
