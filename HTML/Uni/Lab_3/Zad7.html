    <h2>By Charles Dickens</h2>
    <p class="intro">
        I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an 
        Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humoer with themselfs, with 
        each other, wtih the season, or with me. May it hunt their houses
        pleasantly, and no one with to lay it.

    <h3>Stave 1: Marley's Ghost</h3>
    <p>
        Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
        The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman,  
        the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scroog signed it. And Scrooge's name
        was good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to.
